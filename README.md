GeneratorLCG.cpp
>The following program contains the LCG generator. The first line should contain four numbers m, a, c and X0. In the next lines, the program displays successive pseudo-random numbers generated by the LCG generator set by coefficients until the cycle is closed. The contents of the meter should be written out so that the user can check whether the LCG generator had a maximum cycle equal to m - with incorrectly selected m coefficients a and c the generator cycle can close faster than after generating m pseudo-random numbers.
